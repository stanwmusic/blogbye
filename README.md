Hi. I'm blog bye, underscores's little brother. WordPress use to be all about that blogging but in recent years it's become a full fledged CMS. Even if you were making a business theme you still had to worry about the blogging bits. 

I think that's silly, with blog bye you can create themes without having to worry about the blog stuff as the blogging portions of WordPress have all been hidden/removed. Sure there are plugins that do something similar to this but I felt that whether to including the blogging bit was a decision best left to themes.
